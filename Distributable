This week work on distributing events to different modules in the system



StreamDescirption data type


Within the StreamDescription monad, the function that returns a StreamdDescription should
just return a handle to the event stream

In reality it is returning something that will be handed down by a caller


In the function we describe how the envent streams are set up and we return the event setup computation
as an IO action



The functions that make event handlers, they just provide the logic where they come from or how they combine
Therefore they do not dircectly create the event handlers and triggers themselves, they just
use the event handlers and triggers that are provided
