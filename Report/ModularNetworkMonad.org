* Modularising Reactive Stream Declarations

It is desireable for the programmer to be able import a reactive stream from different modules and use
them to declare their own reactive stream.

A stream is created by generating two values, the event stream itself, and a trigger for the event stream.
#+begin_src haskell
do
    (eventStream, eventTrigger) <- newAddHandler
    register eventStream putStrLn
    eventTrigger "Hello!"
#+end_src

If we put this in a function we get

#+begin_src haskell
createEventStream :: 


#+end_src
